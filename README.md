# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Classification

# üéØ **What You're Aiming For**

## Objective: Train a neural network to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as positive or negative.

# Dataset: The dataset contains movie reviews with corresponding sentiments (positive or negative). It's stored in a file named [IMDB Dataset.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hyCr4UPsYdHsvrlGksnOR8J-Zol4zwoy/view?usp=sharing).

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Instructions**

### Tools and Libraries Required:
- Python
- Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities
- TensorFlow/Keras for building and training neural network models

## Steps:

### Data Loading and Exploration
1. **Load the data** using Pandas.
2. **Explore the dataset** to understand the distribution of sentiments, the length of reviews, and other characteristics.

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Convert all reviews to lower case.**
2. **Remove HTML tags and URLs** from reviews.
3. **Tokenize the text and remove stop words.**
4. **Use TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text data into a format suitable for input into the neural network.

### Model Building
1. **Construct a Sequential model** with Dense layers:
   - First layer: Dense, ReLU activation (input dimension should match the number of features from TF-IDF).
   - Hidden layers: experiment with different sizes and activations.
   - Output layer: Dense, Sigmoid activation (binary classification).
2. **Compile the model** with binary crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics.

### Model Training
1. **Train the model** using the training set.
2. **Use a validation split** to monitor performance on unseen data during training.
3. **Adjust parameters** like the number of epochs and batch size as needed.

### Evaluation
1. **Evaluate the model** on a separate test set to assess its performance.
2. **Use metrics** such as accuracy and loss.

### Visualization
1. **Plot training and validation loss over epochs.**
2. **Plot training and validation accuracy over epochs.**

### Report
1. **Provide insights** gained from the project.
2. **Discuss any challenges** faced and how they were overcome.
3. **Suggest potential improvements** for the model or preprocessing steps.

# üìù **Note**
- Test the model thoroughly to ensure it is working correctly.
- Consider user experience and design the process to be intuitive and easy to use.
- Consult documentation or seek help from the community if you encounter any issues.
